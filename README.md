RFID Based security system

The IoT Based Smart Door Lock Security System is a modern security solution that uses the 
power of the Internet of Things (IoT) to protect homes and buildings from unauthorized access. 
This system is designed to provide a high level of security and convenience to homeowners by 
allowing them to control the access to their properties remotely.
The system consists of a smart lock that is connected to the internet and controlled by a mobile 
app. The app allows homeowners to lock and unlock the door from anywhere in the world, as 
long as they have an internet connection. The lock also has advanced features such as voice 
recognition, facial recognition, and fingerprint recognition, which enhance the security of the 
system.
The IoT Based Smart Door Lock Security System is also designed to be highly customizable, 
allowing homeowners to set specific access permissions for different users. For example, a 
homeowner can grant temporary access to a contractor or delivery person, and then revoke that 
access when it is no longer needed.
